nlohmann/json for Spicy
=======================

This folder contains a vendored files from <https://github.com/nlohmann/json>.
That Github repository contains a lot of history which we do not need, but
which makes recursive clones of the Spicy repository slow, see e.g.,
<https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/2088>; we instead vendor selected
files.
