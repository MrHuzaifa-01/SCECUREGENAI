##! This module collects properties of the Zeek installation.
##!
##! Directories are absolute and guaranteed to exist. Not all are necessarily in
##! operational use -- this depends on how you're running Zeek (as a standalone
##! process or clusterized, via zeekctl or the Management framework, etc).
##!
##! For details about Zeek's version, see the :zeek:see:`Version` module.
